The simplest way to setup the development environment for the pdf.js project:

* Git for Windows (http://code.google.com/p/msysgit/);

* Mozilla build environment (http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/mozilla/libraries/win32/MozillaBuildSetup-Latest.exe).

If the Visual Studio is not installed or to avoid switching between the git bash and the Mozilla build environment, modify any startXXX.cmd file in the c:\mozilla-build to look like https://gist.github.com/1518181 .
