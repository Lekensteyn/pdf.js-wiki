This is a wiki page about tests, and ideas about how to enhance them.

For example it could be useful to have a list of features per documents page to avoid running the same page on the thousand of page of the pdf spec. It will also be an explicit test coverage instead of the current: "run tests and see if something is broken, even if we didn't know it was covered before"
