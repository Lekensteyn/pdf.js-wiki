The easiest and recommended way of setting up a development environment for PDF.js is to use Git for Windows. Follow the steps below to create your development environment:

* Install Node.js from http://nodejs.org.

* Install Git for Windows from https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases. Make sure that Unix line endings are set by executing the following command from Git Bash:

  ```> git config --global core.autocrlf input```
